This is a shell coded around the OpenAI system and to start it, you must type "python3 pythonAI.py"
For it to function, you will need to create a Gemini API key at (https://aistudio.google.com/) and place it in the marked spot.

Depending on the system you are using, you may need to enter the .venv system.
If you are using a Linux system, you will likely need to do this.
To enter .venv you must type "source .venv/bin/activate" since I've already provided the source for it.
